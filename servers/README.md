ioHomes App is a mobile-based social network application to bring homes in the neighborhood together. It’s targeted at developing countries like Myanmar where the spirit of neighborhood is high, but it is gradually getting vague due to struggling lifestyle of people. It also aims to solve issues such as security, disaster (like fire, which is quite common), energy insufficiency and shortage.
In the country like Myanmar, where mobile penetration is quite high despite the lack of infrastructure and energy, this is what ioHomes can take advantage of as a mobile app, to bring benefits to the neighborhoods across the country.

ioHomes focuses on 3 aspects:
1.	Connectivity of IoT devices with users
a.	Home devices
From the app, users will be able to check the status of or control the devices. They will also be able view summary of energy usage from smart meters, smart plugs. Devices like IP cams, alarms, smoke detectors, AWS IoT Button, can help users to monitor the safety of their homes and alert them proactively.

b.	Devices in neighborhood
Outdoor IoT cameras will help make the neighborhood safe from potential and suspicious activities. They can also assist in solving parking issues. 

2.	Communication
a.	Awareness of neighborhood
As ioHomes user living in a neighborhood, one can optionally share their info such as their profession, skills, education, business services. As another user in the same neighborhood, one can know better of its neighborhood such that how many IT professionals, doctors, how many restaurants, where is the nearest plumbing service available, without necessarily having to know the person’s name or where he lives at. Once user knows, he can further communicate via ioHomes’ chat feature.

b.	Door-To-Door Chat
For users living in apartment or condo, they rarely know each other and have the contact. If any issue or information to share/ask, they will have to go and knock the door. With this feature of ioHomes, user can conveniently message the apartment above his, in order to reduce the noise or alert about electricity issue in the building.

c.	Get-To-Know Chat
Nowadays, compared to the past, people get to know less and less of their neighbors. This random chat will connect two people in the neighborhood for chat.

d.	Message/Post to the neighborhood
This is to broadcast a post to the users in the neighborhood, whether be it a simple recommendation of a restaurant, asking about a nearest plumbing service, loss and found pets/items, suspicious activities, fire alerts or an advertisement of your own skills/services.

e.	Government
Government departments can have ioHomes account, based on its location in the neighborhood. Users can connect to police station, fire bridgate, energy departments for messaging, complaints, assistance, alerts. With payment platform of ioHomes, government services can be integrated into the app in the future.

3.	Collaboration
Once the users get to know better of their neighborhood and neighbors, it becomes much easier to do things together. As a community based on the neighborhood, one can raise funds for the poor and unhealthy, organize festive/religious events, run health-awareness/education campaigns, do volunteering work to go green, solve issues such as parking, security.
